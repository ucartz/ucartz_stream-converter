## About Ucartz  SSL Stream Converter

SSL Stream Converter is a web application. You can covert multiple non-SSL(HTTP) streams to SSL(HTTPS) streams using SSL Stream Converter.

##How does it work?


- First, you need to download the .zip file.
- Upload the .zip file to your Hosting control panel under the public directory once you have downloaded the file.
- Extract the (.zip) file.
- Within the folder, you can see another file, named vendor.zip, and you need to extract this file, either.
- Now create a database and import the ssl_stream_converter.sql (You can find this .sql file under the root directory) file.
- Open the .env file and update database details (DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD).
- With this, you are ready to use the Ucartz Stream SSL Converter.
- Open your favourite browser and then open the URLâ€”for instance, https://yourdomain/ or https://yourdomain/yourfolder.
- You must be able to see the home page of your SSL Stream Converter. Please register and start using the SSL Stream Converter.


##Things to remember

- The first user has admin privileges. An admin can decide on active users and manage them through the user management option. Only active users can log in.
- If the SSL Stream converter App does not work, the admin can check the system requirements under the review menu (via the link https://yourdomain/system-requirement).
- 'Forgot password' will work only after updating the SMTP details in the .env file.


Note: If you don't see the .env file, go to settings and tick the option "Show hidden files" (applicable only if you are using the cPanel control panel).
